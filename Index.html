              <li>R33 (1995–1998): The R33 improved upon the R32 in terms of stability and refinement while retaining much of the performance. It is known for having better aerodynamics and a more comfortable ride compared to its predecessor.</li>
              <li>R34 (1999–2002): The R34 is perhaps the most beloved among enthusiasts, known for its aggressive styling and technology. It had a more refined version of the RB26DETT engine, a six-speed Getrag manual transmission, and advanced features like multi-function displays on the dashboard.</li></ul></p>

                <li>Founded by Ettore Bugatti: Bugatti was founded in 1909 by Ettore Bugatti in Molsheim, Alsace, a region that was then part of the German Empire (today it's part of France).

This philosophy still holds true today in the brand’s vehicles, with an emphasis on attention to detail, elegance, and engineering excellence.</li>

                    <h3> History of Koenigsegg</h3>
                    <li>Founder: Christian von Koenigsegg, a Swedish entrepreneur, founded Koenigsegg Automotive AB in 1994 with the vision of creating the world’s best hypercars. At just 22 years old, he embarked on a journey to build high-performance cars that could compete with the world’s best, and eventually surpass them in both speed and technological innovation.</li>
                    <li>First Model: The first production car was the Koenigsegg CC (introduced in 1996), followed by the CC8S in 2002, which marked the company’s entry into the hypercar world. However, it was the development of their next generation of cars that would truly cement Koenigsegg's status in the automotive world.</li>
                    <li>The CC8S was the first production car from Koenigsegg, and it made a significant impact in the automotive world. The CC8S was a supercar with a 5.0-liter V8 engine producing 655 horsepower and was capable of reaching speeds of up to 240 mph (386 km/h).</li>
